Description

### Objective
The project utilizes the publicly available bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips dataset to analyze Chicago taxi trip data. The dataset contains detailed information about taxi trips, including trip start and end times, pickup and dropoff locations, fare, tips, tolls, and payment methods. SQL queries in Google BigQuery are employed to extract insights from the data.

### Goals
1. Calculate Key Statistics for Trip Duration
Determine the average, median, and standard deviation of trip durations (trip_seconds) for trips occurring on Mondays and Saturdays. Compare the statistics for both days to observe trends.
2. Identify High-Demand Routes
Find the top five routes (from pickup_community_area to dropoff_community_area) with the highest number of trips in 2023, providing insights into popular travel corridors.
3. Analyze Payment Methods and Costs
Compare the average costs of fares, tips, tolls, and extras across different payment methods for trips in 2019 to understand customer payment preferences and spending behaviors.

### Results
1. Trip Duration Statistics
- Mondays and Saturdays exhibit different patterns in trip durations, reflecting variations in travel behaviors or conditions.
- The average, median, and standard deviation provide a comprehensive view of trip duration variability on each day.
2. Top Routes in 2023
- The most frequented routes are identified, highlighting key community areas with high travel demand.
- These results can be useful for transportation planning and optimizing taxi services.
3. Payment Method Analysis
- Different payment methods (e.g., cash, credit card) show variations in fare, tips, tolls, and extras.
- Insights from this analysis can inform business strategies, such as promoting specific payment methods or adjusting pricing.
 
### Conclusion
Using SQL on BigQuery to analyze the Chicago taxi trips dataset yields valuable insights into urban mobility patterns, customer behaviors, and operational trends. The findings provide actionable data for taxi service providers, urban planners, and policymakers to enhance service efficiency, cater to customer preferences, and address high-demand routes effectively.
